- *[Micos Corvus Eco](http://micosusa.com/old/Con_o_02.html) Microstep Controller* and 
respective [axes](https://www.physikinstrumente.com/en/products/linear-stages/
stages-with-stepper-dc-brushless-dc-bldc-motors/vt-80-linear-stage-1206300/) 
(inspired by [Micos.py](https://gist.github.com/pklaus/3955382)),

as well as some code for accessing video devices like USB-cameras.
